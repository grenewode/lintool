# lintool
A handy tool for simple semantics

Currently, this does not have a nice, interaface, since I have not built a parser yet. However, the interpreter does support the following:
1. Entities / Truth values
2. Function evalulation
3. Type checking (but not checking predicates such as the)
4. Adding things to the model

It does not yet support
1. The denotation of The
2. Custom comosition rules
